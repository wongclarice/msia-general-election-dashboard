# Malaysia General Election Dashboard

## Problem Statement

This dashboard provides insights into the general election results for 2018 and 2022, broken down by region and party. It illustrates the number of seats won by each party, the winning margins, and demographic results through maps. Additionally, it visualizes the total votes received by each party and the voter turnout percentage by state.
